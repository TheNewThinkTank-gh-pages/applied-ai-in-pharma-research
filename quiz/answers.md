## **Applied AI in Medical & Molecular Imaging Quiz - Answers**

**1. Which AI algorithm is most commonly used for tumor segmentation in MRI scans?**  

**Answer:** B) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  

*Explanation:* CNNs excel at spatial data analysis and are the gold standard for image segmentation tasks like tumor detection in medical imaging.

**2. How can transfer learning address the challenge of limited annotated medical imaging data?**  

**Answer:** B) By adapting pre-trained models to medical tasks with fine-tuning  

*Explanation:* Transfer learning leverages knowledge from large datasets (e.g., natural images) and adapts it to specialized medical tasks with limited data.

---

**3. What is a major risk of overfitting in AI models trained on small medical imaging datasets?**

**Answer:** B) Poor performance on new, independent datasets

*Explanation:* Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise or idiosyncrasies of the training data, failing to generalize to real-world scenarios.

---

**4. Which of the following best describes the role of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in medical imaging?**

**Answer:** B) Generating synthetic medical images to augment training datasets

*Explanation:* GANs are used to create realistic synthetic images (e.g., rare pathologies) to improve model robustness when real data is scarce.

---

**5. Which ethical concern arises when deploying AI models trained on biased medical imaging datasets?**  

**Answer:** C) Reinforcement of disparities in diagnostic accuracy across populations  

*Explanation:* Biased training data (e.g., underrepresentation of minority groups) can lead to models performing poorly for certain demographics.

---

**6. Which technique is most appropriate for improving the interpretability of an AI model in molecular imaging?**

**Answer:** B) Applying Grad-CAM to visualize regions of interest in PET/CT scans  

*Explanation:* Grad-CAM highlights critical image regions influencing a model’s decision, crucial for clinician trust and validation.

---

**7. What is a key advantage of federated learning in medical AI?**

**Answer:** B) Training models across decentralized institutions without sharing raw data

*Explanation:* Federated learning ensures data privacy by aggregating model updates (not raw data) across hospitals, complying with regulations like GDPR/HIPAA.

---

**8. Which metric is most suitable for evaluating the performance of an AI model segmenting brain tumors?**

**Answer:** B) Dice Coefficient

*Explanation:* The Dice Coefficient measures overlap between predicted and ground-truth segmentations, critical for imbalanced medical data.

---

**9. What is the primary challenge in integrating multimodal data (e.g., PET, MRI, genomics) into a single AI model?**

**Answer:** B) Aligning heterogeneous data formats and scales

*Explanation:* Multimodal integration requires harmonizing diverse data types (e.g., images, tabular data, sequences) with different resolutions and normalization needs.

---

**10. How might AI impact personalized medicine in oncology imaging?**

**Answer:** B) Predicting patient-specific responses to therapies using radiomic features

*Explanation:* Radiomics extracts quantitative features from images, enabling AI to correlate imaging traits with genomic/molecular profiles for tailored treatments.

---

**Bonus Question:**  

**What regulatory framework must AI-based medical devices comply with in the United States?**

**Answer:** B) FDA’s SaMD guidelines

*Explanation:* The FDA regulates AI/ML-based software as a medical device (SaMD), requiring validation and approval for clinical use.
