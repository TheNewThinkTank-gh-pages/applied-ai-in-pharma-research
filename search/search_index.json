Which AI algorithm is most commonly used for tumor segmentation in MRI scans? </p> <p>Answer: B) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  </p> <p>Explanation: CNNs excel at spatial data analysis and are the gold standard for image segmentation tasks like tumor detection in medical imaging.</p> <p>2. How can transfer learning address the challenge of limited annotated medical imaging data? </p> <p>Answer: B) By adapting pre-trained models to medical tasks with fine-tuning  </p> <p>Explanation: Transfer learning leverages knowledge from large datasets (e.g., natural images) and adapts it to specialized medical tasks with limited data.</p> <p>3. What is a major risk of overfitting in AI models trained on small medical imaging datasets?</p> <p>Answer: B) Poor performance on new, independent datasets</p> <p>Explanation: Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise or idiosyncrasies of the training data, failing to generalize to real-world scenarios.</p> <p>4. Which of the following best describes the role of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in medical imaging?</p> <p>Answer: B) Generating synthetic medical images to augment training datasets</p> <p>Explanation: GANs are used to create realistic synthetic images (e.g., rare pathologies) to improve model robustness when real data is scarce.</p> <p>5. Which ethical concern arises when deploying AI models trained on biased medical imaging datasets? </p> <p>Answer: C) Reinforcement of disparities in diagnostic accuracy across populations  </p> <p>Explanation: Biased training data (e.g., underrepresentation of minority groups) can lead to models performing poorly for certain demographics.</p> <p>6. Which technique is most appropriate for improving the interpretability of an AI model in molecular imaging?</p> <p>Answer: B) Applying Grad-CAM to visualize regions of interest in PET/CT scans  </p> <p>Explanation: Grad-CAM highlights critical image regions influencing a model\u2019s decision, crucial for clinician trust and validation.</p> <p>7. What is a key advantage of federated learning in medical AI?</p> <p>Answer: B) Training models across decentralized institutions without sharing raw data</p> <p>Explanation: Federated learning ensures data privacy by aggregating model updates (not raw data) across hospitals, complying with regulations like GDPR/HIPAA.</p> <p>8. Which metric is most suitable for evaluating the performance of an AI model segmenting brain tumors?</p> <p>Answer: B) Dice Coefficient</p> <p>Explanation: The Dice Coefficient measures overlap between predicted and ground-truth segmentations, critical for imbalanced medical data.</p> <p>9. What is the primary challenge in integrating multimodal data (e.g., PET, MRI, genomics) into a single AI model?</p> <p>Answer: B) Aligning heterogeneous data formats and scales</p> <p>Explanation: Multimodal integration requires harmonizing diverse data types (e.g., images, tabular data, sequences) with different resolutions and normalization needs.</p> <p>10. How might AI impact personalized medicine in oncology imaging?</p> <p>Answer: B) Predicting patient-specific responses to therapies using radiomic features</p> <p>Explanation: Radiomics extracts quantitative features from images, enabling AI to correlate imaging traits with genomic/molecular profiles for tailored treatments.</p> <p>Bonus Question: </p> <p>What regulatory framework must AI-based medical devices comply with in the United States?</p> <p>Answer: B) FDA\u2019s SaMD guidelines</p> <p>Explanation: The FDA regulates AI/ML-based software as a medical device (SaMD), requiring validation and approval for clinical use.</p>"},{"location":"quiz/questions/","title":"Quiz questions","text":"<p>I have tried to tailor this multiple-choice quiz for primarily PhD students in medical and molecular imaging, focusing on applied AI concepts.
